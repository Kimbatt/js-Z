# js-Z
Javascript obfuscator, using the power of zalgo


Try it here: https://kimbatt.github.io/js-Z

With this tool, you can make your javascript code pretty unreadable.  
See demo page here: https://kimbatt.github.io/js-Z/demopage

Note: this tool is not really a powerful obfuscator; with the right tools, the original code can be easily recovered.  
So if you really want to hide your code, you should run it through a *real* obfuscator (like [this one](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator)) first (then put its output in here).
